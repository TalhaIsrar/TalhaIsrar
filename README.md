I am Talha Israr, a Erasmus Mundus Master’s student and hardware design enthusiast, focusing on digital design and embedded systems. 

My background includes:
- Hardware Design & RTL: SystemVerilog, VHDL, Chisel, C/C++
- Tools & Simulation: ModelSim, Onespin (formal verification basics), Quartus, Vitis HLS, MATLAB/Simulink
- Embedded Systems & AI: FPGA and SoC projects, Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano/TX2/AGX, deployment of AI on edge devices
- Data Analysis & Machine Learning: Python, R, PyTorch, TensorFlow, SQL, Tableau, Power BI

Key Interests:
- Pipelined processor design, hazard handling, branch prediction
- AMBA protocols and peripheral interfacing
- High-performance and reliable digital system development

I am eager to contribute to hardware design and verification projects, bridging theory and practical implementation in modern digital systems.
